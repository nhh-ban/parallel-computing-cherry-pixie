## Assignment 4 
   
# This is one way of solving it - maybe you have a better idea? 
# First, write a function for simulating data, where the "type" 
# argument controls the distribution. We also need to ensure 
# that the mean "mu" is the same for both distributions. This 
# argument will also be needed in the t-test for the null 
# hypothesis. Therefore, if we hard code in a value here 
# we may later have an inconsistency between the mean of the 
# distributions and the t-test. So, we add it as an explicit 
# argument:

           mu = mu)$p.value
  }


# Running many tests is almost the same as before.
# Here the mean is hard coded in, as we're not
# going to change it.

# As you see, with normally distributed data, N can

# "large enough" can be many thousands. If we try
